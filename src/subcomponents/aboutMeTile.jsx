                I'm a graduate of Farmingdale State College with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Systems with a minor in Sociology.
                My interest in programming began when my brother showed me SpriteKit when I was 14.
                Through creating my first game I learned to love the idea of creating something that could be experienced by people all over the world.
                This drew me toward web development.
                Now I have a focus in React and Redux, as well as game development.
                When Iâ€™m not making websites, I like to make or play video games.
                Feel free to check out some of my projects or my GitHub page listed below.
